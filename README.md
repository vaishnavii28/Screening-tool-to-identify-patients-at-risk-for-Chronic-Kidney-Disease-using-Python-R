# Screening-tool-to-identify-patients-at-risk-for-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-using-Python-R
Tools Used - Logistic Regression, Python, R, Microsoft Excel 
-The objective was to use statistical analysis to identify the key parameters of Chronic Kidney Disease upon which this model can be used a screening tool to identify patients at risk for CKD 
-A dataset with patient demographics and clinical parameters of around 8000 patients was cleaned to address null values and outliers. The issue of class imbalance was addressed by stochastic sampling method. 
-Logistic Regression was then used to identify key variables that contribute to the development of Chronic Kidney Disease 
-Since recall of the model was more important than accuracy and precision, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to pick the right threshold for probability.
